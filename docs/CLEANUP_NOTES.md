# Cleanup Notes - 2025-12-26

## Items Reviewed

### 1. `htmlcov/` Folder ✅ DELETED
**What it is:** HTML coverage reports generated by pytest-cov

**Purpose:** View code coverage in browser (e.g., `htmlcov/index.html`)

**Decision:** DELETE
- Build artifact, not needed in repo
- Can be regenerated anytime with `pytest --cov --cov-report=html`
- Already in `.gitignore`

**Action:** Deleted folder

### 2. Sample Data - `data-sample/` vs `tests/fixtures/` ✅ KEPT BOTH
**Investigation:**
- `data-sample/` - Used by `build.py`, bundled into test build .exe
- `tests/fixtures/sample_memoir/` - Appears unused by tests (checked conftest.py, test files)

**Decision:** KEEP `data-sample/`, DELETE `tests/fixtures/sample_memoir/`
- `data-sample` is actively used by build process
- `tests/fixtures/sample_memoir` appears to be unused legacy code
- Tests create temp data directories instead

**Action:**
- Kept `data-sample/`
- Deleted `tests/fixtures/sample_memoir/` (unused)

## Summary

### Deleted:
- `htmlcov/` (coverage reports, regenerable)
- `tests/fixtures/sample_memoir/` (unused duplicate)

### Kept:
- `data-sample/` (used by build.py for test builds)
- `tests/fixtures/` (directory kept, may be used for other fixtures)

## Future Cleanup Candidates

### Build Artifacts
All in `.gitignore`, safe to delete:
- `build/` - PyInstaller temp files
- `dist/` - Built .exe files
- `*.spec` - PyInstaller spec files
- `__pycache__/` - Python bytecode
- `.pytest_cache/` - Pytest cache

### Deprecated Files (to review)
- Check for old session notes (already deleted `SESSION_NOTES_PHASE3_FOLDER_PICKER.md`)
- Review any `.bak` files
- Check for old TODO files

### Large Files (if any)
```bash
find . -type f -size +5M
```
Currently none found.

## Regenerating Coverage Reports

If you need the HTML coverage report:
```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html  # View in browser
```

## .gitignore Coverage

Already ignores:
```
# Build artifacts
build/
dist/
*.spec
__pycache__/

# Test artifacts
htmlcov/
.pytest_cache/
.coverage

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Local config
data/
*.log
```

All appropriate items are ignored.
