Pandemic lockdown started. Suddenly home with my plants 24/7. They became my coworkers. Started saying good morning to them. They were better listeners than most humans on Zoom calls.

Plant count: 27. Caught myself photographing a new leaf unfurling on my Monstera. Sent the photo to five people. Three responded politely. One left me on read. Mom said 'That's nice, dear.' The plant community on Reddit gave me 500 upvotes. Found my people.

Went on a date. She asked about hobbies. Talked about plants for 20 minutes straight before catching myself. There was no second date. Gerald says she wasn't good enough for us anyway.
