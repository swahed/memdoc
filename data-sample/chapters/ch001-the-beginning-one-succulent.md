Stopped at a gas station on Route 95 and saw a tiny succulent in a plastic cup for $2.99. It looked sad. I looked sad. We bonded. Named it Gerald. This was my first mistake.

Gerald survived a whole week! Called my mom to brag. She laughed for a solid minute, then said 'Call me when it's been a month.' Challenge accepted.

ONE MONTH ANNIVERSARY with Gerald! Celebrated by buying him a nicer pot. Also bought a small fern 'to keep Gerald company.' Named the fern Beatrice. My apartment now has two plants. I am basically a botanist.
